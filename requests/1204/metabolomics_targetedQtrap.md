Mass spectrometry analysis

Targeted mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a QTRAP5500 instrument interfaced to an Agilent 1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography (LC) system controlled using Analyst software (version 1.6.3). For analysis, samples were directly separated by an analytical column (2.1mm x 50mm, Kinetix F5 1.7Âµm, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 0.4mL/min. For analyte elution the gradient held at an initial starting condition of 25% mobile phase B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 2-minutes before ramping to 60% B over 0.9 minutes, ramping to 90% B over 0.1-minutes and holding for 0.9-minutes, ramping to 25% B in 0.1-minutes, with a final equilibration at 25% B for 2-minutes (total run time of 6-minutes, mobile phase A = 0.1% formic acid in water). Data acquisition on the QTRAP5500 utilized a targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition scheme at 'unit' resolution with transitions for ve3 (Q1 mass = 431.1, Q3 mass = 387.1, DP=120, CE=70, dwell=100msec), ve3 (Q1 mass = 431.1, Q3 mass = 345.1, DP=120, CE=70, dwell=100msec), and indomethacin (Q1 = 358.1, Q3 = 138.9, DP=150, CE=22, dwell=10msec) with a total cycle time of 0.22 seconds. The QTRAP was globally set to use a positive ion spray voltage of 5500, CAD gas of 5, curtain gas of 25, temperature of 450, gas 1 of 45, and a gas 2 setting of 50. The entrance potential was globally set to 10, and the cell exit potential to 10.
