MS Data Acquisition

Targeted mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a QTRAP5500 instrument interfaced to an Agilent 1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography (LC) system. For analysis, peptide samples were directly separated by an analytical column (2.1mm x 50mm, Kinetix F5, Phenomenex). The gradient ramped from an initial starting condition of 2% mobile phase B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 34% B over 0.9 minutes, with sample pickup and column equilibration using an additional 5.1 minutes (6 minutes total run time, mobile phase A = 0.1% formic acid in water) at a flow rate of 400uL/min. Data acquisition on the QTRAP5500 utilized a targeted multiple reaction monitoring acquisition scheme. Specifically, the QTRAP was globally set to use a positive ion spray voltage of 5000, collision gas of 5, curtain gas of 25, temperature of 450, gas 1 of 45, and a gas 2 setting of 30. The declustering potential was globally set to 120, entrance potential to 10, and cell exit potential to 10. All MRM transitions were set to a scan duration setting of 20msec, yielding a total cycle time of 0.3751 seconds. The resulting data were analyzed using Skyline software (version 23.1.0.455).
