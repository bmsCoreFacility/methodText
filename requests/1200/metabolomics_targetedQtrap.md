Mass spectrometry analysis

Targeted mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a QTRAP5500 instrument interfaced to an Agilent 1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography (LC) system controlled using Analyst software (version 1.6.3). For analysis, samples were directly separated by an analytical column (2.1mm x 50mm, Kinetix F5 1.7Âµm, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 0.4mL/min. For analyte elution the gradient held at an initial starting condition of 10% mobile phase B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 2-minutes before ramping to 60% B over 0.9 minutes, ramping to 90% B over 0.1-minutes and holding for 1-minute, ramping to 10% B in 0.25-minutes, with a final equilibration at 10% B for 1.75-minutes (total run time of 6-minutes, mobile phase A = 0.1% formic acid in water). Data acquisition on the QTRAP5500 utilized a targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition scheme at 'unit' resolution with transitions for ibogain (Q1 mass = 311.20, Q3 mass = 174.09, DP=120, CE=75, dwell=80msec), noribogain (Q1 mass = 297.20, Q3 mass = 160.09, DP=120, CE=75, dwell=80msec), labeled lysine (Q1 mass = 155.10, Q3 mass = 137.10, DP=60, CE=12, dwell=20msec), and labeled threonine (Q1 = 125.10, Q3 = 60.10, DP=60, CE=21, dwell=20msec) with a total cycle time of 0.22 seconds. The QTRAP was globally set to use a positive ion spray voltage of 5500, CAD gas of 5, curtain gas of 25, temperature of 450, gas 1 of 55, and a gas 2 setting of 60. The entrance potential was globally set to 10, and the cell exit potential to 10.
